## Forecasting Stock Prices Using Deep Learning Approaches

In this study, exploring the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), for forecasting stock prices. The dataset is from yahoo finance nad extracted using yfinance python package. The implementation of deep learning is using the Tensorflow Keras package.
